	"TaskDescription": "Participants completed a continuous recognition version of the Mnemonic Similarity Task (MST; Kirwan & Stark, 2007; S. M. Stark, Yassa, Lacy, & Stark, 2013) while undergoing fMRI scanning. In this task, participants were shown a series of color photographs of everyday objects, one at a time. Some of the objects were only shown once (foils), some objects appeared twice (repeats), and some objects consisted of paired images that were visually and conceptually similar (lures). The use of lure items is thought to enhance interference and result in an increased need for pattern separation (Yassa & Stark, 2011). For each object shown, participants were asked to identify (by pressing one of three buttons) whether it was 'new' (if they did not remember seeing the image before), 'similar' (if they remembered seeing an image that was similar to, but not exactly the same as the present image), or 'old' (if they remembered previously seeing the exact same image). The delay between the first presentation and repeated presentation of lure or repeated objects varied with a mean lag of 19 trials. Six blocks of 108 stimuli, for a total of 648 images, were presented. Participants were required to respond within 2.5s, after which time the stimulus was replaced by a blank screen with a fixation cross for .5s followed by the next stimulus."
